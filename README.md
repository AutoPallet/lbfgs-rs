# `L-BFGS` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/korken89/lbfgs-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/korken89/lbfgs-rs)

> `L-BFGS` ([Low-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS)) is a library for doing
> estimation and application of Hessians in numerical optimization while using
> limited memory and never explicitly creating the Hessian. Only simple vector
> operation are used, as specified by the L-BFGS algorithm.

Active WIP.
